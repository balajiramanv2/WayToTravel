#### I have highlighted briefly about me - by providing details about my background, reason why I have penchant for travelling and places I have been to. I have highlighted pages within the website - Guide, Contact, Travel(Home)
## Guide
#### For any one to travel to different places, I have mentioned basic details that user would need to travel to a country. I have connected using restcountries.com api to provide these information. Response is obtained in JSON format and it includes details like Capital, Population, Languages spoken and most importantly currency of the country. There was a decision to choose between this or with countrylayer.com and since restcountries API was more compatible and provide precise results, I opted for restcountries API.
