                <p>
                    I've provided my top recommendations for places to visit in Italy along with
                     my suggested itinerary to get you started. Make a plan, giving priority to your
                      interests and preferences, as not everyone's employment or lifestyles permit a
                       three-week trip. Spend more time in Florence if you're fascinated about Renaissance art.
                        A week could be spent touring the hill towns of Italy. Make your way to the Dolomites if you
                         want mountains. And if you've always wanted to climb the Leaning Tower in Pisa, this is the
                          perfect opportunity.
