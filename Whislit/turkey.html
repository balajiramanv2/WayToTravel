                    you are arranging a trip there. Turkey is a big country, but if you just have
                     14 days there, you'll still have plenty of time to see many of the most well-known 

                    <p>sights.We recommend visiting Istanbul, Cappadocia, Antalya, Fethiye, Pamukkale, Ku≈üadas, 
                        Ephesus, Troy, Anakale, Gallipoli,
                         and Ankara during your two weeks in Turkey.</p>
